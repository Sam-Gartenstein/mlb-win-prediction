# MLB Win Prediction

## Internal TODO List

**Game Preprocessing** Notebook and Associated Scripts:

- Update order of the functions in the batter and pitching scripts to reflect their order in the notebooks
- For checking the number of games at each major point in the notebook, make a function that can work wtih all other dataframes, and rather than return the dataframe, return `True` or `False` and have an assert statement
- Double check if rolling values are computing correctly, especially for Rolling Pitching Rate Metrics
